      "['Many people with skin diseases such as chronic wounds, non-healing and diabetic\\nulcers need reconstruction and regeneration of their skin.', 'In addition, the medical industry also\\nneeded a method of skin rejuvenation and reconstruction for cosmetic purposes, even for\\nhealthy people.', 'Reconstructive medicine used the method to deliver pluripotent stem cells to the\\n33 years after the introduction of bone marrow stem cells, fat-derived stem cells have\\nbecome an excellent source for cell therapy.', 'In 1961, two Canadian scientists first introduced\\nstem cells.', 'These cells, later found to be hematopoietic stem cells, have been used successfully\\nto treat leukemia and some severe autoimmune diseases called bone marrow transplants.', 'In\\n1968, another stem cell was introduced into the bone marrow, which has been shown to be\\neffective due to its high ability to regulate immunity in many diseases, including skin, bone, joint\\ndiseases, heart, brain, nerves, and kidney.', 'Nevertheless, it took scientists another 33 years to\\ndiscover that human adipose tissue also has a stem cell, similar to bone marrow stem cells.', 'Each gram of human fat has 100 to 500 times more stem cells than bone marrow and is easier\\nto obtain.', 'Although there are differences in bone marrow stem cells and fat, these advantages\\nhave attracted the attention of many researchers.', 'Mesenchymal stem cells are the most interesting because when they get placed in the\\nright environment and are coupled with the proper growth factors, they can choose a pathway to\\ndifferentiate into that targeted tissue.', 'Also, they are very accessible, inexpensive, easy to\\nextract, and reproducible.', 'The sources of these mesenchymal stem cells are bone marrow,\\nbone, connective tissues, fats, etc.', 'The best reservoir that has recently been discovered for\\nmesenchymal cells is fat.', 'Fats are made out of fibrous, collagen fibers, and fibroblasts.', 'On one hand, by injecting collagenase enzymes into the fat, all the collagen fibers and\\nfibroblasts would slip away, and the pure mesenchymal stem cells would be available.', 'On the\\nother hand, In the engineered stem cell vascular fraction (SVF), which is a pellet containing\\nmesenchymal cells, growth factors, inflammatory cells like macrophage-monocyte and\\nfibroblasts, the mesenchymal cells get separated from all the other components by the\\ncentrifugation process.', 'Placing the mesenchymal stem cells into the targeted environment and\\nproviding the proper growth factors can produce fibroblasts and collagen to reconstruct the skin.', 'As mentioned above, the stem cell environment is critical, and there is a possibility of\\nstem cell movement due to the blood flow and paracrine, which the stem cell would secrete and\\naffect its environment.', 'Therefore, the matrix that keeps the stem cell in its place from getting\\nflushed away by the blood flow and affecting its environment, known as the scaffold, was\\ndiscovered.', 'The scaffold has to have specific characteristics that would avoid a foreign body\\nreaction; It could not be antigenic ,allergic, or infectious.', 'Additionally, it needed to be accessible\\nand cheap to produce.', \"The newest method utilized has been using alginate scaffolds, containing\\nthe mesenchymal cells and the essential growth factors, into the targeted cell resulting in\\nstimulating the CD44 receptors on the skin's fibroblasts, causing a rush of collagen production.\", 'As we learned in our lectures, the green fluorescent protein bone marrow was implanted into\\nnon-green fluorescent protein mice resulting from HCT, (hematopoietic cell transplantation)\\nimproved the animal survival in a mouse model, which was surprising.', 'In this paper, the tissue regeneration\\nof skin and the probability of hair growth\\nfrom stem cells are being investigated.', 'Over\\ntime, The biological skin replacement has\\ndramatically improved from individual\\napplication of skin cells to cells and scaffold\\ncombinations for treatments, healing, and\\nacute and chronic skin wounds.', 'Permanent skin substitutes with cellular\\nengineering combination has shown to have\\ncrucial wound closure of more than 90% of\\nthe total body surface region in burns [7].', 'As\\nan advantage the morbidity and

of lymphatic networks and\\nstable vascular, hair follicles, sweat glands,\\nadipose, and inadequate innervation are\\nsome of the missing elements of cellular or\\nbiological skin replacements

'developmental biology into possible\\nbiological skin replacements can have a full\\nrecovery of anatomy and physiology, along\\nwith eliminating morbidity from skin wounds\\nIn recent years, improvements in\\nearly wound excision, respiratory\\nassistance, fluid revival, treatment of\\ninhalation damage, enhanced immune\\nfunction, infection prevention, integration of\\naerobic activity during healing, and\\nadvancement of anti-scarring techniques\\nhave all been accomplished in burn care.', 'These advancements also resulted in\\nsubstantial decreases in death,\\nhospitalization, and long-term morbidity.', 'Many strategies for healing deep partial and\\nfull-thickness burns have been developed\\nby researchers, including the placement of\\nthe epidermal barrier through autologous or\\nallogeneic transplantation.', 'Autologous cells\\ncan permanently reside on the wound to\\nhave definitive wound closure.', 'In contrast,\\nallogeneic cells can stay on the wound for a\\nfew days or weeks; However, the\\ncombination of the allogeneic fibroblast with\\nbiodegradable scaffolds would provide\\nextracellular matrix and growth factors\\ncomponents would facilitates faster wound\\nclosure by motivating autologous healing,\\nbut it does not last long maybe for only a\\nfew days to weeks.', 'Although these methods do tend to\\ndecrease mortality in major burns, after\\ntransplantation, they neglect hair follicles\\nand glands.', 'Scientists use techniques which\\ncan damage cells such as multi-layering of\\na variety of cells and the transition of\\ncell-matrix droplets onto a substrate known\\nas \"ink-jet printing,\" by amplifying a laser\\npulse.', 'The brief exposures to high pressure,\\ntemperature, or biochemical toxins would\\ndamage the cells [7].', 'autologous engineered skin substitutes.', 'Regenerative medicine is meant to\\nrestore the functionality of a harmed,\\n malfunctioning, or absent tissue.', 'In\\nregenerative medicine, there are three\\nprimary methods.', 'Cell-based therapies are\\nthe first approach executed by the cells that\\nare delivered to either directly regenerate a\\ntissue or through the paracrine functions.', 'The second method, the material-based\\nmethods focuses on biodegradable\\nmaterials that are often fabricated with\\ncellular functions.', 'The most important\\nmethod, that

      "\n",
      "Skin is the protective barrier that shields the body from environmental insults\n",
      "(1). The outermost layer of the skin, the epidermis (epithelium), is separated from the\n",
      "dermis (mesenchyme) by a thin layer of highly organized extracellular matrix (ECM)\n",
      "proteins that comprise the dermal-epidermal junction (DEJ). This type of ECM is\n",
      "categorized as a supramolecular matrix arrangement termed basement membrane\n",
      "(BM), to which are added anchoring proteins that serve to reinforce dermo-epidermal\n",
      "cohesion. BMs compartmentalize, provide structural support, and regulate cell\n",
      "behavior through signaling activities that influence tissue growth, guide cell migration,\n",
      "and support cell survival (2, 3). Largely populated by keratinocytes, the epidermis\n",
      "undergoes constant turnover as epidermal stem cells of the basal layer, which have a\n",
      "high proliferative potential, constantly generate new daughter cells or transit-\n",
      "amplifying cells. After a few cycles of division, daughter cells begin a process of\n",
      "terminal differentiation (cornification), leading to the formation of the stratum corneum\n",
      "(4). Epidermal integrity and renewal depend on the balance between proliferation and\n",
      "differentiation of the basal layer of keratinocytes that are in contact with the BM.\n",
      "Additionally, various growth factors, morphogens, and other regulatory\n",
      "macromolecules tethered to the BM provide signals involved in governing\n",
      "keratinocyte adhesion, differentiation, stratification, and survival (5, 6).\n",
      "\n",
      "One particularity of the DEJ is that it includes very sophisticated anchoring\n",
      "proteins, which reinforce the cohesion between dermis and epidermis, and thereby\n",
      "increase the epidermis’ resistance to the mechanical forces to which the skin is\n",
      "constantly subjected. These anchoring complexes link basal keratinocytes via\n",
      "attachment dots called hemidesmosomes that span the BM and anchor the dermis\n",
      "\n",
      "through specific elements called anchoring fibrils. These essential structures contain\n",
      " specific components, such as a6f4 integrin, laminin (LM) isoform 332, and collagens\n",
      "Vil and XVII (7). The DEJ is formed through contributions from both epidermal and\n",
      "dermal cells (8), and it exhibits a distinctive microarchitecture characterized by an\n",
      "undulating pattern due to epidermal projections into the dermis that intercalate\n",
      "between dermal papillae (7, 9). This BM geometry increases the surface area of the\n",
      "DEJ, strengthens the dermal—epidermal connectivity, and imposes mechanical\n",
      "constraints on keratinocytes with consequences on their fate (9). Thus, the function\n",
      "of the epidermis relies on mechanical, structural, and biochemical support from the\n",
      "\n",
      "underlying DEJ.\n",
      "\n",
      "STRUCTURAL ORGANIZATION OF THE DERMAL-EPIDERMAL JUNCTION\n",
      "Within the skin, the DEJ provides essential structural support to the adjacent\n",
      "basal epidermal keratinocytes (10, 11), constituting a specific informative niche that\n",
      "mediates signals and plays a preponderant role in epidermal renewal (12). The basic\n",
      "structure of the DEJ can be viewed as a BM assembled according to the commonly\n",
      "accepted model (5, 8, 13). The BM framework is comprised of two independent\n",
      "networks of polymerized LMs and cross-linked collagen IV that are interconnected\n",
      "and stabilized by the glycoprotein nidogen and the heparan sulphate (HS)\n",
      "proteoglycan, perlecan (Fig. 1). Collagen IV is the most abundant structural\n",
      "component of the BM, and it is largely responsible for its mechanical properties (14,\n",
      "15). The combination of three a collagen chains, a101a2(IV) is the most abundant\n",
      "collagen IV molecule in all BMs (16), while the a5a5a6(IV) isoform is also present in\n",
      "the DEJ (17). Collagen IV a chains contain an N-terminal 7S domain, a central\n",
      "collagen domain, and a C-terminal non-collagenous (NC)1 domain (18). This\n",
      "\n",
      "structure enables collagen IV molecules to self-aggregate into dimers through their\n",
      " NC1 domains, and into tetramers through their N-terminal 7S domains, leading to\n",
      "formation of a hexameric network (Fig. 1) (19). It is believed that the covalent\n",
      "crosslinks of the collagen IV meshed network are central to the mechanical\n",
      "properties of the BM (20-22).\n",
      "\n",
      "Although collagen IV may be essential for BM integrity, it is not critical to its\n",
      "initial formation (23). Indeed, LM is considered the initiator of BM assembly at the\n",
      "basolateral surface of cells. Secreted LMs are comprised of a, B, and y chains\n",
      "assembled into a heterotrimer that has an asymmetrical, cruciform shape (Fig. 1)\n",
      "(24). CDNA sequencing has led to identification of the primary structures of five LM a\n",
      "chains (a1, a2, a3, a4, and a5), four B chains (61, B2, 83, and B4), and three y\n",
      "chains (y1, y2, and y3), yielding at least 18 heterotrimeric isoforms (25). Moreover,\n",
      "due to alternative splicing, the gene encoding the a3 chain produces two splice\n",
      "variants: a short-a3A chain and a long-a3B. As long as each of the three constituent\n",
      "LM chains includes an N-terminal LN domain, LMs can self-associate into polymeric,\n",
      "sheet-like networks (26-28). These LM networks are mainly non-covalent in nature,\n",
      "allowing dynamic interactions. To initiate BM assembly, the laminin G-type (LG)\n",
      "modules LG1—LG5 at the C-terminus of the a chain, which protrude from the LM long\n",
      "arm, bind directly to cells through cell surface receptors: integrins, a-dystroglycan,\n",
      "and sulfated glycolipids (29, 30). This property enables recruitment of other BM\n",
      "components, including nidogen, collagen IV, and perlecan, in a temporal hierarchy\n",
      "(Fig. 1) (31, 32). The LM network of the epidermal BM results from self-assembly of\n",
      "the heterotrimer a581y1 or LM-511. Various analyses have revealed that the\n",
      "supramolecular organization of BMs is asymmetrical and bifunctional. The two faces\n",
      "have different exposed proteins: a LM-rich epithelial side and a collagen-rich stromal\n",
      "\n",
      "side (33). Atomic force microscopic studies have revealed that BM polarization is\n",
      " characterized by distinct mechanical properties, the epithelial side being 2-4 times\n",
      "stiffer than the stromal side (33).\n",
      "\n",
      "Two other LM isoforms found in the DEJ, LM-332 (a3AB3y2) and LM-311\n",
      "(a3AB1y1) (34-36), are unable to self-assemble because their constitutive a3 and/or\n",
      "y2 chains are truncated at the N-terminal end, such that they lack the required LN\n",
      "domains. However, networks containing LM-332 have been purified from skin,\n",
      "indicating that some form of LM assembly occurs (37). Their integration follows a\n",
      "different type of assembly pattern specific to BMs underlying epithelia that are\n",
      "subjected to strong mechanical forces, such as the DEJ (36, 38). For integration into\n",
      "the DEJ, LM-332 first cross-links with LM-311, forming a complex better equipped for\n",
      "integration (34, 39). In addition, both monomeric LM-332 and the LM-332/311 dimer\n",
      "associate with the N-terminal NC1 domain of collagen VII (40, 41). Collagen VII\n",
      "homotrimers a1a101(VII) dimerize and form fibrillar structures, called anchoring\n",
      "fibrils, which firmly connect the DEJ to the superficial dermis. Dermal epidermal\n",
      "cohesion depends on the interaction that occurs within the LN domain of the LM 63\n",
      "chain and the fibronectin-like III repeats within the NC1 domain of collagen VII (42,\n",
      "43). LM-332 is critical for dermo-epidermal anchorage, because it associates with\n",
      "basal epidermal keratinocytes through its C-terminal domains, initiating and\n",
      "maintaining hemidesmosomes, and binding to collagen VII through its N-terminus (7,\n",
      "36). Hemidesmosomes are highly organized adhesion structures formed in the basal\n",
      "layer of the epidermis, where they link the BM with the keratin-containing\n",
      "intermediate filament cytoskeleton, providing mechanical strength and durability (44).\n",
      "Both LM-332/311 and LM-511 are secreted from keratinocytes, and they incorporate\n",

      "intracellular molecular assemblies critical for hemidesmosome assembly and stability\n",
      "(46, 47). Finally, collagen XVIII, which belongs to the multiplexin (multiple-helix\n",

multi-layered keratinocytes, the epidermis is continuously renewed by\\nproliferation of stem cells and the differentiation of their progeny, which undergo\\nterminal differentiation as they leave the basal layer and move upward toward the\\nsurface, where they die and slough off.', 'Basal keratinocytes rest on a basement\\nmembrane at the dermal-epidermal junction that is composed of specific extracellular\\nmatrix proteins organized into interactive and mechanically supportive networks.', 'Firm\\nattachment of basal keratinocytes, and their dynamic regulation via focal adhesions\\nand hemidesmosomes, are essential for maintaining major skin processes, such as\\nself-renewal, barrier function, and resistance to physical and chemical stresses.', 'The\\nadhesive integrin receptors expressed by epidermal cells serve structural, signaling,\\nand mechanosensory roles that are critical for epidermal cell anchorage and tissue\\nhomeostasis.', 'More specifically, the basement membrane components play key roles\\nin preserving the stem cell pool, and establishing cell polarity cues enabling\\nasymmetric cell divisions, which result in the transition from a proliferative basal cell\\nlayer to suprabasal cells committed to terminal differentiation.', 'Finally, through a well-\\nregulated sequence of synthesis and remodeling, the components of the dermal-\\nepidermal junction play an essential role in regeneration of the epidermis during skin\\nhealing.', 'Here too, they provide biological and mechanical signals that are essential to\\nthe restoration of barrier function.', 'Keywords: epidermis; basement membrane; dermal-epidermal junction, extracellular\\nmatrix; polarity; stem cell; regeneration; aging.', 'Skin is the protective barrier that shields the body from environmental insults\\n(1).', 'The outermost layer of the skin, the epidermis (epithelium), is separated from the\\ndermis (mesenchyme) by a thin layer of highly organized extracellular matrix (ECM)\\nproteins that comprise the dermal-epidermal junction (DEJ).', 'This type of ECM is\\ncategorized as a supramolecular matrix arrangement termed basement membrane\\n(BM), to which are added anchoring proteins that serve to reinforce dermo-epidermal\\ncohesion.', 'BMs compartmentalize, provide structural support, and regulate cell\\nbehavior through signaling activities that influence tissue growth, guide cell migration,\\nand support cell survival (2, 3).', 'Largely populated by keratinocytes, the epidermis\\nundergoes constant turnover as epidermal stem cells of the basal layer, which have a\\nhigh proliferative potential, constantly generate new daughter cells or transit-\\namplifying cells.', 'After a few cycles of division, daughter cells begin a process of\\nterminal differentiation (cornification), leading to the formation of the stratum corneum\\n(4).', 'Epidermal integrity and renewal depend on the balance between proliferation and\\ndifferentiation of the basal layer of keratinocytes that are in contact with the BM.', 'Additionally, various growth factors, morphogens, and other regulatory\\nmacromolecules tethered to the BM provide signals involved in governing\\nkeratinocyte adhesion, differentiation, stratification, and survival (5, 6).', 'One particularity of the DEJ is that it includes very sophisticated anchoring\\nproteins, which reinforce the cohesion between dermis and epidermis, and thereby\\nincrease the epidermis’ resistance to the mechanical forces to which the skin is\\nconstantly subjected.', 'These anchoring complexes link basal keratinocytes via\\nattachment dots called hemidesmosomes that span the BM and anchor the dermis\\nthrough specific elements called anchoring fibrils.', 'These essential structures contain\\n specific components, such as a6f4 integrin, laminin (LM) isoform 332, and collagens\\nVil and XVII (7).', 'The DEJ is formed through contributions from both epidermal and\\ndermal cells (8), and it exhibits a distinctive microarchitecture characterized by an\\nundulating pattern due to epidermal projections into the dermis that intercalate\\nbetween dermal papillae (7, 9).', 'This BM geometry increases the surface area of the\\nDEJ, strengthens the dermal—epidermal connectivity, and imposes mechanical\\nconstraints on keratinocytes with consequences on their fate (9).', 'Thus, the function\\nof the epidermis relies on mechanical, structural, and biochemical support from the\\nSTRUCTURAL ORGANIZATION OF THE DERMAL-EPIDERMAL JUNCTION\\nWithin the skin, the DEJ provides essential structural support to the adjacent\\nbasal epidermal keratinocytes (10, 11), constituting a specific informative niche that\\nmediates signals and plays a preponderant role in epidermal renewal (12).', 'The basic\\nstructure of the DEJ can be viewed as a BM assembled according to the commonly\\naccepted model (5, 8, 13).', 'The BM framework is comprised of two independent\\nnetworks of polymerized LMs and cross-linked collagen IV that are interconnected\\nand stabilized by the glycoprotein nidogen and the heparan sulphate (HS)\\nproteoglycan, perlecan (Fig.', '1).', 'Collagen IV is the most abundant structural\\ncomponent of the BM, and it is largely responsible for its mechanical properties (14,\\n15).', 'The combination of three a collagen chains, a101a2(IV) is the most abundant\\ncollagen IV molecule in all BMs (16), while the a5a5a6(IV) isoform is also present in\\nthe DEJ (17).', 'Collagen IV a chains contain an N-terminal 7S domain, a central\\ncollagen domain, and a C-terminal non-collagenous (NC)1 domain (18).', 'This\\nstructure enables collagen IV molecules to self-aggregate into dimers through their\\n NC1 domains, and into tetramers through their N-terminal 7S domains, leading to\\nformation of a hexameric network (Fig.', '1) (19).', 'It is believed that the covalent\\ncrosslinks of the collagen IV meshed network are central to the mechanical\\nproperties of the BM (20-22).', 'Although collagen IV may be essential for BM integrity, it is not critical to its\\ninitial formation (23).', 'Indeed, LM is considered the initiator of BM assembly at the\\nbasolateral surface of cells.', 'Secreted LMs are comprised of a, B, and y chains\\nassembled into a heterotrimer that has an asymmetrical, cruciform shape (Fig.', '1)\\n(24).', 'CDNA sequencing has led to identification of the primary structures of five LM a\\nchains (a1, a2, a3, a4, and a5), four B chains (61, B2, 83, and B4), and three y\\nchains (y1, y2, and y3), yielding at least 18 heterotrimeric isoforms (25).', 'Moreover,\\ndue to alternative splicing, the gene encoding the a3 chain produces two splice\\nvariants: a short-a3A chain and a long-a3B.', 'As long as each of the three constituent\\nLM chains includes an N-terminal LN domain, LMs can self-associate into polymeric,\\nsheet-like networks (26-28).', 'These LM networks are mainly non-covalent in nature,\\nallowing dynamic interactions.', 'To initiate BM assembly, the laminin G-type (LG)\\nmodules LG1—LG5 at the C-terminus of the a chain, which protrude from the LM long\\narm, bind directly to cells through cell surface receptors: integrins, a-dystroglycan,\\nand sulfated glycolipids (29, 30).', 'This property enables recruitment of other BM\\ncomponents, including nidogen, collagen IV, and perlecan, in a temporal hierarchy\\n(Fig.', '1) (31, 32).', 'The LM network of the epidermal BM results from self-assembly of\\nthe heterotrimer a581y1 or LM-511.', 'Various analyses have revealed that the\\nsupramolecular organization of BMs is asymmetrical and bifunctional.', 'The two faces\\nhave different exposed proteins: a LM-rich epithelial side and a collagen-rich stromal\\nside (33).', 'Atomic force microscopic studies have revealed that BM polarization is\\n characterized by distinct mechanical properties, the epithelial side being 2-4 times\\nstiffer than the stromal side (33).', 'Two other LM isoforms found in the DEJ, LM-332 (a3AB3y2) and LM-311\\n(a3AB1y1) (34-36), are unable to self-assemble because their constitutive a3 and/or\\ny2 chains are truncated at the N-terminal end, such that they lack the required LN\\ndomains.', 'However, networks containing LM-332 have been purified from skin,\\nindicating that some form of LM assembly occurs (37).', 'Their integration follows a\\ndifferent type of assembly pattern specific to BMs underlying epithelia that are\\nsubjected to strong mechanical forces, such as the DEJ (36, 38).', 'For integration into\\nthe DEJ, LM-332 first cross-links with LM-311, forming a complex better equipped for\\nintegration (34,

organized adhesion structures formed in the basal\\nlayer of the epidermis, where they link the BM with the keratin-containing\\nintermediate filament cytoskeleton, providing mechanical strength and durability (44).', 'Both LM-332/311 and LM-511 are secreted from keratinocytes, and they incorporate\\ninto the BM zone of hair follicles and interfollicular epidermis.', 'Another component of\\nthis

DERMAL-EPIDERMAL JUNCTION PROVIDES ADHESION AND SIGNALING\\nIntegrin-mediated cell-matrix adhesions play a key role in linking the\\ncytoskeleton to the BM.', 'Within the epidermis, the most abundant,

basal layer (51).', 'More recently, its clustering at keratinocyte cell-cell\\nadhesions was demonstrated to coordinate the stabilization of adherens junctions\\nBasal keratinocytes closely interact with the BM through both integrin a3B1-\\nenriched focal adhesions and a6B4-induced hemidesmosomes.', 'Intracellularly, these\\ntwo integrins interact with and respectively regulate the actin and keratin\\ncytoskeletons via a multitude of scaffold and regulatory proteins (53, 54).', 'Firm\\nkeratinocyte attachment and dynamic regulation via focal adhesions and\\nhemidesmosomes are essential to maintain major skin functions, such as self-\\nrenewal, barrier function, and resistance to physical and chemical stresses.', 'The C-\\nterminal G domain of the a3 chain in LM-332 is the ligand for both the a361 and a6B4\\n integrins in keratinocytes, and it can promote the formation of these two different\\ntypes of attachment structures (55-57).', 'Focal adhesions allow dynamic, through\\nreversible associations with integrins, while hemidesmosomes form stable,\\nmechanically-resistant adhesion complexes.', 'Upon binding to LM-332,\\nhemidesmosomes assemble through the interaction of the B4 integrin cytoplasmic tail\\nwith collagen XVII and plectin, which binds to intermediate filaments in the cytoplasm\\n(58).', 'Recent data highlight the close connections between these two types of\\nadhesion structures, particularly during keratinocyte migration, when\\nhemidesmosomes go through dynamic remodeling (59, 60).', 'Hemidesmosomes are also considered signaling platforms.', 'Following\\nactivation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGF-R), the 84 integrin subunit\\ncytoplasmic tail is phosphorylated, leading to the extracellular signal-regulated kinase\\n(ERK)/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphatidyl inositol-3 kinase\\n(PI-3K) signaling cascade engagement that supports growth and survival (54, 61,\\n62).', 'In this manner, junctional and cytoskeletal proteins control the maintenance of\\nthe stem cell population that resides in the epidermal basal layer.', 'Hemidesmosome\\nintegrity, associated with sufficient collagen XVII expression in basal keratinocytes,\\nguarantees the potential for symmetrical stem cell division and epidermal\\nhomeostasis (63).', 'It was recently proposed that collagen XVII connection with the\\natypical protein kinase C (aPKC)-partitioning defective (Par) complex may be a\\nmechanism for regulating epidermal cell polarity (64).', 'LM-332 is predominantly expressed in the BM underlying CD271* human\\ninterfollicular stem cells at the top of the dermal papilla, where this protein has been\\nsuggested to impact keratinocyte differentiation (65).', 'Conditional deletion of LM-332\\nin the epidermis of adult mice profoundly disturbs the keratinocyte differentiation\\n program, leading to exaggerated expression of terminal differentiation markers and\\nmajor F-actin-related cell shape anomalies—a phenotype indicating disrupted\\nmechanosensitive signaling pathways (66).', 'Furthermore, data from junctional\\nepidermolysis bullosa patients indicate that epidermal stem cell preservation requires\\na LM-332/a6B4 integrin-induced adhesion-dependent mechanical pathway to support\\nthe activity of the mechanosensitive transcriptional regulator Yes-associated protein\\n(YAP) (67).', 'Interestingly, Caenorhabditis elegans hemidesmosomes, which are\\nstructurally and functionally analogous to vertebrate hemidesmosomes, have also\\nbeen identified as mechanosensors (68).', 'In humans, LM-332/integrin B4/plectin\\nassociation reportedly plays a role in the regulation of cellular mechanical forces\\nthrough mechanosensitive cross-talk with focal adhesions (60).', 'These elements\\ndemonstrate that, in addition to being a mainstay in epidermal anchorage, LM-332\\nsignaling also strongly impacts epidermal homeostasis.', 'Notably, LM-332 research\\ngoes far beyond the context of skin biology, and its effect on cancer stem cell\\nquiescence has been addressed in other recent reviews (69, 70).', 'Accumulating data indicate that LM-511 is involved in the status and
